# Human-Recognition-CV-CNN

This is a **real-time object and human recognition project** using **Computer Vision** and **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)**.  
It allows you to **train the model on the fly** using webcam-captured images of people or objects.

The model asks for the **number of classes (people or objects)**, along with their **names** and **dataset sizes**.  
It then captures images accordingly and uses them to train a CNN.  
Once training is complete, the model can **recognize the person or object live via webcam**.

ðŸ“„ The system is interactive and fully customizable â€” from dataset size to training epochs.

## How to Run:

1. Open **Windows PowerShell** or any terminal.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Create and activate a **Python virtual environment**.
4. Run the setup script:  
   `python setup.py`
5. Install required libraries manually using:  
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. Start the recognition program by following on-screen prompts.
